What is in this release?

In this release you will find data about software distributed and/or crafted publicly on the Internet. You will find information about its development, its distribution and its relationship with other software included as a dependency. You will not find any information about the individuals who create and maintain these projects.

This dataset contains seven csv files:

Projects

A project is a piece of software available on any one of the 34 package managers supported by Libraries.io.

Versions

A Libraries.io version is an immutable published version of a Project from a package manager. Not all package managers have a concept of publishing versions, often relying directly on tags/branches from a revision control tool.

Tags

A tag is equivalent to a tag in a revision control system. Tags are sometimes used instead of Versions where a package manager does not use the concept of versions. Tags are often semantic version numbers.

Dependencies

Dependencies describe the relationship between a project and the software it builds upon. Dependencies belong to Version. Each Version can have different sets of dependencies. Dependencies point at a specific Version or range of versions of other projects.

Repositories

A Libraries.io repository represents a publically accessible source code repository from either github.com, gitlab.com or bitbucket.org. Repositories are distinct from Projects, they are not distributed via a package manager and typically an application for end users rather than component to build upon.

Repository dependencies

A repository dependency is a dependency upon a Version from a package manager has been specified in a manifest file, either as a manually added dependency committed by a user or listed as a generated dependency listed in a lockfile that has been automatically generated by a package manager and committed.

Projects with related Repository fields

This is an alternative projects export that denormalizes a projects related source code repository inline to reduce the need to join between two data sets.
